# No creative gamemode

No creative gamemode is a restrictive datapack for Minecraft that forcefully sets all players to Survival mode every tick.
Even if someone switches to Creative or Spectator using commands or cheats, the datapack immediately reverts them back.
Ideal for challenge maps, servers with strict rules, or adventure setups where Creative access must be completely blocked.

## Features
- Forces Survival gamemode every game tick
- Works on all players, including operators
- Prevents use of Creative or Spectator mode at all times

- Reload the world or run ``/reload``
